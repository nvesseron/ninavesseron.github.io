I am a PhD student at CREST, ENSAE, under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net/), since October 2022. Before my PhD, I was a student at École Normale Supérieure Lyon in the Department of Computer Science. I also hold a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning from École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, through the MVA program (Mathematics, Vision and Learning).
